Long Term Support
-----------------
Version 1.2 will be supported until 2020.

What ?
------
*Grapher* is a high performance data fetcher and collection relationship manager for Meteor and MongoDB:

1. Makes data MongoDB denormalization easy (storing and linking data in different collections) 
2. You can link your MongoDB data with any type of database, and fetch it via Queries
3. You have the same API for data-fetching whether you want your data to be reactive or not.
4. It is compatible with simpl-schema and the older version of it.

Sample
-------------

To give you an idea how this works, you can fetch the data like this:

```
{
    users: {
        profile: 1,
        githubTickets: {},
        posts: {
            title: 1,
            comments: {
                text: 1,
                date: 1,
                author: {
                    profile: 1
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
