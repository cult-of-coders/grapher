## Introducing BlueLibs

- [GitHub BlueLibs Monorepo](https://github.com/bluelibs/bluelibs)
- Following the same bold vision of Meteor, but with a modern twist. www.bluelibs.com
- Read more about our approach coming from Meteor: https://www.bluelibs.com/blog/2021/11/26/the-meteor-of-2022
- We've implemented [Grapher aka Nova](https://www.bluelibs.com/products/nova) as a standalone npm package compatible to native MongoDB drivers (including Meteor), it is not as feature-rich (no meta links, no pubsub functionality) but is more advanced.

# Grapher 1.5

_Grapher_ is a Data Fetching Layer on top of Meteor and MongoDB. It is production ready and battle tested. Brought to you by [Cult of Coders](https://www.cultofcoders.com) ‚Äî Web & Mobile Development Company. 

Main features:

*   Innovative way to make MongoDB relational
*   Blends in with Apollo GraphQL making it highly performant
*   Reactive data graphs for high availability
*   Incredible performance
*   Denormalization ability
*   Connection to external data sources
*   Usable from anywhere

It marks a stepping stone into evolution of data, enabling developers to write complex and secure code,
while maintaining the code base easy to understand.

### Quick Illustration

Query:

```js
createQuery({
    posts: {
        title: 1,
        author: {
            fullName: 1,
        },
        comments: {
            text: 1,
            createdAt: 1,
            author: {
                fullName: 1,
            },
        },
        categories: {
            name: 1,
        },
    },
}).fetch();
```

Result:

```
[
    {
        _id: 'postId',
        title: 'Introducing Grapher',
        author: {
            _id: 'authorId',
            fullName: 'John Smith
        },
        comments: [
            {
                _id: 'commentId',
                text: 'Nice article!,
                createdAt: Date,
                author: {
                    fullName: 1
                }
            }
        ],
        categories: [ {_id: 'categoryId', name: 'JavaScript'} ]
    }
]
```

### Testing

You can create `test` directory and configure dependencies (working directory is the root of this repo):
```
# create meteor app for testing
# you can add a specific release with --release flag, this will just create the app with the latest release
meteor create --bare test 
cd test
# install npm dependencies used for testing
meteor npm i --save selenium-webdriver@3.6.0 chromedriver@2.36.0 simpl-schema@1.13.1 chai

# Running tests (always from ./test directory)
METEOR_PACKAGE_DIRS="../" TEST_BROWSER_DRIVER=chrome meteor test-packages --once --driver-package meteortesting:mocha ../
```

If you use `TEST_BROWSER_DRIVER=chrome` you have to have chrome installed in the test environment. Otherwise, you can just run tests in your browser.

Another option is to use `puppeteer` as a driver. You'll have to install it with `meteor npm i puppeteer@10`. Note that the latest versions don't work with Node 14.

With `--port=X` you can run tests on port X.

Omit `--once` and mocha will run in watch mode.
